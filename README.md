# Energy-Transition-Model
This is a toy model to look at the pathway toward netzero emission power system by 2050.
It has three nodes, stochastic process, long-term horizon of 15 years.
The model is formulated as stochastic programming.
The model is developing at NTNU and called EMPIRE.
It includes three parts: 1.Data 2.Stochastic scenario generator 3.Main body of optimization problem.

It has possiblity to increase the number of nodes, timeslices, and long-term periods.
